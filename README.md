# PasswordGenarator
Hello guys! This is a password-generator that I programmed with Python. The usage is very simple, when you execute the file you only have to specify how long the password should be. If you don't enter anything, the default length will be 9 characters long. Then a password with numbers, upper- and lower-case letters and symbols will be generated. I hope you like it!
